.SH NAME
\f[CB]libvdeplug_vdesl\f[R] \[en] vdesl vdeplug module: ethernet over
serial link
.SH SYNOPSIS
libvdeplug_vdesl.so
.SH DESCRIPTION
This libvdeplug module creates point\-to\-point virtual ethernet
networks over serial links.
.PP
This module of libvdeplug4 can be used in any program supporting vde
like \f[CB]vde_plug\f[R], \f[CB]vdens\f[R], \f[CB]kvm\f[R],
\f[CB]qemu\f[R], \f[CB]user\-mode\-linux\f[R] and \f[CB]virtualbox\f[R].
.PP
The vde_plug_url syntax of this module is the following:
.PP
\f[CB]vdesl://\f[R]\f[I]device_path\f[R] [ \f[CB][\f[R] OPTION [
/OPTION]\&...\f[CB]]\f[R] ]
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[CB]speed\f[R]=\f[I]baudrate\f[R]
Set the baud rate of the serial link.
This plugin supports the following baud rates:
9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 230400, 460800, 500000, 576000,
921600, 1000000,
1152000, 1500000, 2000000, 2500000, 3000000, 3500000, 4000000.
High baud rates may not be supported by the uart hardware or could
provide an unreliable service
due to communication errors.
In order to achieve high speeds the cables should be short and
properly shielded from electro\-magnetic noise.
.SH EXAMPLES
Scenario: two hosts connected by a serial line.
e.g.: RS\-232 serial ports connected by a null modem cable, USB\-ttl
cables or USB\-FTDI boards or UART pins of System\-on\-Chip
point\-to\-point connected so that the RXD on one end is connected to
TXD on the other and viceversa.
.PP
In the following we use the device \f[CB]/dev/ttyAMA0\f[R], this may be
changed to address the actual device (e.g.\ \f[CB]/dev/ttyS0\f[R],
\f[CB]/dev/ttyS1\f[R], \f[CB]/dev/ttyUSB0\f[R],
\f[CB]/dev/ttyACM0\f[R]\&...).
No other processes should be using the serial port (e.g.\ no
getty\-login process should be active on it).
.PP
The following command (on both hosts) creates two vde namespaces
connected by a virtual point\-to\-point ethernet network.
.IP
.EX
vdens vdesl:///dev/ttyAMA0
.EE
.PP
Run the following command on both hosts to create a virtual interface
named \f[CB]vdesl0\f[R] on each end.
The two interfaces are connected by a 4Mbaud link.
.IP
.EX
sudo vde_plug \-d tap://vdesl0 vdesl:///dev/ttyAMA0[speed=4000000]
.EE
